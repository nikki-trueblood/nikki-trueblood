**Hello! 👋 I'm Nikki Trueblood, a UC Berkeley data science student who loves 🍵 matcha, 🧶 crochet, and the applications of data to 🏥 healthcare and 🌱 environmental problems!**

- 🐻 I'm a junior studying Data Science with a domain emphasis on Social Welfare, Health, and Poverty at UC Berkeley.
- 📖 My favorite things about data science are storytelling with data and applying concepts in computing, statistics, and AI to real-world problems.
- 🧠 I recently learned probability theory, am currently learning Tableau, and hope to learn more about LLMs. 
- 💬 I'm always up for discussing data ethics, the importance of DEI, and the best movies/tv shows.
- 🎥 I love exploring new art mediums and have most recently enjoyed filming and editing a video for my most recent internship! Check it out here: ____.
